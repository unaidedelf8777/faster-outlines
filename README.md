<div align="center">Supercharge your structured text generation with <strong>faster-outlines</strong> - a high-<br>performance Rust backend for the Outlines library.</div>

## Overview

faster_outlines is designed to significantly boost the performance of regex-guided text generation, particularly for LLM inference servers. It's an ideal solution for scenarios where regex patterns for guiding LLM generation are not known in advance.

Key features:
- üöÄ Seamless one-line integration with existing Outlines projects
- üöÄ All the features you already love about outlines 
- ‚ö° Asynchronous FSM compilation for immediate start of LLM inference
- üèéÔ∏è Substantial performance improvements, especially for complex regex patterns ( like JSON )
- üîÑ Continuous updates to improve speed!

Upcoming:
- üç¥ vLLM fork using faster_outlines
- ü§ù Official integration with vLLM's main repo (hopefully)
- Better FSM Caching
- Redis as a caching backend, for large inference setups

## Why faster_outlines?

1. **Optimized for LLM Inference Servers**: Ideal for scenarios where regex patterns are dynamic and not known beforehand.

2. **Asynchronous Processing**: Unlike the standard Outlines library, faster_outlines allows you to start LLM inference immediately, without waiting for the entire FSM to compile.

3. **Significant Performance Boost**: Especially noticeable with complex regex patterns and large state spaces.

4. **Seamless Integration**: Works with your existing Outlines code with minimal changes.


## Installation

```bash
pip install faster_outlines
```

## Quick Start

Integrating faster_outlines into your project is as simple as adding one line of code:

```python
import outlines
from faster_outlines import patch

patch(outlines)

# Now use outlines as you normally would
# Your code here...
```


## Example

```python
import outlines
from faster_outlines import patch

patch(outlines)

model = outlines.models.transformers("mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2", device="cuda:0", model_kwargs={"load_in_8bit": True})

schema = '''{
    "title": "Character",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "name": {
            "title": "Name",
            "maxLength": 10,
            "type": "string"
        },
        "age": {
            "title": "Age",
            "type": "integer"
        },
        "armor": {"$ref": "#/definitions/Armor"},
        "weapon": {"$ref": "#/definitions/Weapon"},
        "strength": {
            "title": "Strength",
            "type": "integer"
        }
    },
    "required": ["name", "age", "armor", "weapon", "strength"],
    "definitions": {
        "Armor": {
            "title": "Armor",
            "description": "An enumeration.",
            "enum": ["leather", "chainmail", "plate"],
            "type": "string"
        },
        "Weapon": {
            "title": "Weapon",
            "description": "An enumeration.",
            "enum": ["sword", "axe", "mace", "spear", "bow", "crossbow"],
            "type": "string"
        }
    }
}'''

model = outlines.models.transformers("mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2", device="cuda:0", model_kwargs={"load_in_8bit": True})
print("Model loaded.")
generator = outlines.generate.json(model, schema)
character = generator("Give me a character description")
print(character)
```

## Performance Comparison

![Performance Graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unaidedelf8777/faster-outlines/main/assets/benchmark.png)
<figcaption style="text-align: center;">Latest as of 7.13.2024 (0.0.46)</figcaption>

The graph above illustrates the performance advantage of faster_outlines over the standard Outlines library. As the complexity of regex patterns increases (measured by the number of FSM states), faster_outlines maintains significantly lower processing times.

For even faster compilation times on machines with more powerful CPUs ( such as inference servers ), the number of threads is automatically scaled according to the number of available threads. scaling rules are as follows: 

- 1-4 CPU threads: Uses 1 thread
- 5-8 CPU threads: Uses 2 threads
- 9+ CPU threads: Uses ~1/4 of available threads (min 2, max 16)

However, if you would like to manually control the number of threads used, you can do so via environment variable:

```bash
export FASTER_OUTLINES_NUM_THREADS=<num-threads>
```

Please note that setting the number of threads to a number higher than the number of cores / logical threads on your machine **WILL DETERIORATE PERFORMANCE**, not improve it.

If you would like to test performance at different thread counts on your machine, you can use the script at `tests/test_fsm_comp_time.py`, by first running the script using the automatic thread count ( or what ever you are currently using ), and then the number of threads you are thinking of using.

## Compatibility

`faster_outlines` is designed to be fully compatible with the Outlines API, however, currently only full support for version 0.0.46 ( latest as of 7/13/24 ) can be garunteed.
